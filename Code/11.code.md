# Making Ansible Faster


## Disabling SSH Host Key Checking


```bash
export ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False
```


```bash
[defaults]
host_key_checking = False
```


```bash
[all:vars]
ansible_ssh_host_key_checking=False
```


```bash
[web]
10.10.0.2 ansible_ssh_host_key_checking=False
```


## Disabling Fact Gathering


```yaml
---
- hosts: web
  gather_facts: False
```


## Using More Forks


```bash
# ansible.cfg
[defaults]
forks = 25
```


```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -f 25
```


## Optimize How Ansible Uses SSH


```bash
[ssh_connection]
ssh_args = -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=60s
pipelining = True
```


## Use Asynchronous Tasks


```yaml
cat <<EOF > /root/ansible/playbook.yml
---
- hosts: web
  become: yes
  tasks:
  - name: Copy script
    copy:
      src: script.sh
      dest: /tmp/script.sh
      mode: 0755
  - name: Run script
    shell: /tmp/script.sh
  - name: rerun script
    shell: /tmp/script.sh
EOF
```


```bash
cat <<EOF > /root/ansible/script.sh
#!/bin/bash
# backup /var/ directory
tar -czf /tmp/var-$(date +%F-%H-%M-%S).tar.gz /var/
EOF
```


```bash
time ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```


```yaml
cat <<EOF > /root/ansible/playbook.yml
---
- hosts: web
  become: yes
  tasks:
  - name: Copy script
    copy:
      src: script.sh
      dest: /tmp/script.sh
      mode: 0755
  - name: Run script
    shell: /tmp/script.sh
    async: 300
    poll: 5
  - name: rerun script
    shell: /tmp/script.sh
    async: 300
    poll: 5
EOF
```


```bash
time ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```


```yaml
cat <<EOF > /root/ansible/playbook.yml
---
- hosts: web
  become: yes
  tasks:
  - name: Copy script
    copy:
      src: script.sh
      dest: /tmp/script.sh
      mode: 0755
  - name: Run script without polling
    shell: /tmp/script.sh
    async: 300
    poll: 0
  - name: rerun script with polling
    shell: /tmp/script.sh
    async: 300
    poll: 5
EOF
```


## Sequential vs Batch Mode


```yaml
---
- hosts: web
  become: yes
  tasks:
  - name: Install nginx
    apt:
      name: nginx
      state: present
  - name: Install apache2
    apt:
      name: apache2
      state: present
  - name: Install php
    apt:
      name: php
      state: present
```


```yaml
---
- hosts: web
  become: yes
  tasks:
  - name: Install packages
    apt:
      name: "{{ item }}"
      state: present
    loop:
    - nginx
    - apache2
    - php
```


```yaml
---
- hosts: web
  become: yes
  tasks:
  - name: Install packages
    apt:
      name:
      - nginx
      - apache2
      state: present
```


```bash
# first example and second example
apt install nginx
apt install apache2
```


```bash
# third example
apt install nginx apache2
```


## Using Execution Strategies


```yaml
---
- hosts: web
  become: yes
  tasks:
  - name: Install nginx
    apt:
      name: nginx
      state: present
  - name: Install apache2
    apt:
      name: apache2
      state: present
```


```yaml
---
- hosts: web
  become: yes
  strategy: free
  tasks:
  - name: Install nginx
    apt:
      name: nginx
      state: present
  - name: Install apache2
    apt:
      name: apache2
      state: present
```


```bash
[defaults]
strategy = free
```
