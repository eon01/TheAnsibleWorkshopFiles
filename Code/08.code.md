# Ansible Blocks


## What are Ansible Blocks?


## How to Use Ansible Blocks


```yaml
---
- hosts: web
  become: yes
  tasks:
  - name: Install packages
    block:
    - name: Install nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
    - name: Install apache2
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
```


```yaml
---
- hosts: web
  become: yes
  tasks:
  - name: Install packages
    block:
    - name: Install nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
    - name: Install apache2
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
    when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"
```


```yaml
---
- hosts: web
  become: yes
  tasks:
  - name: Install packages
    block:
    - name: Install nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
    - name: Install apache2
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
    ignore_errors: yes
```


## Error Handling with Ansible Blocks


```yaml
cat <<EOF > /root/ansible/playbook.yml
---
- hosts: web
  become: yes
  tasks:
  - name: A block that will fail
    block:
    - name: Good task
      command: /bin/true
    - name: Bad task
      command: /bin/false
    - name: Another bad task
      command: /bin/false
EOF
```


```bash
cd /root/ansible
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```


```yaml
cat <<EOF > /root/ansible/playbook.yml
---
- hosts: web
  become: yes
  tasks:
  - name: A block that will fail
    block:
    - name: Good task
      command: /bin/true
    - name: Bad task
      command: /bin/false
    - name: Another bad task
      command: /bin/false
    rescue:
    - name: Handle errors
      debug:
        msg: "There was an error"
EOF
```


## Using "Rescue" and "Always" Together


```yaml
---
- name: Example Playbook with Blocks and Rescue
  hosts: all
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Installing and Starting Services with Error Handling
      block:
        # Main tasks that might fail
        - name: Install Apache
          apt:
            name: apache2
            state: present

        - name: Start Apache Service
          service:
            name: apache2
            state: started

      rescue:
        # Tasks to run if any of the above fail
        - name: Error Handling - Apache Installation Failed
          debug:
            msg: >
              "Failed to install or start Apache. 
              Check system logs or package 
              management configuration."

        # Optionally, include additional tasks 
        # like sending notifications or creating logs
        - name: Additional Error Handling Steps
          shell: >
            echo "Error encountered with Apache installation" 
            >> /var/log/ansible_error.log

      always:
        # Tasks that run regardless of success or failure of the above tasks
        - name: Always Executed Task
          debug:
            msg: >
              "This task runs irrespective of the success or 
              failure of the Apache installation."
```


```yaml
---
- name: Service Start with Fallback on Failure
  hosts: all
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Start and Monitor Service with Fallback
      block:
        # Attempt to start a service
        - name: Start critical service
          service:
            name: my_critical_service
            state: started

      rescue:
        # If service start fails, gather system logs
        - name: Gather system logs on service start failure
          shell: >
            journalctl -u my_critical_service 
            > /tmp/my_critical_service.log

        # Attempt to start an alternative service
        - name: Start fallback service
          service:
            name: my_fallback_service
            state: started

      always:
        # Notify that the block execution is complete
        - name: Notify block execution status
          debug:
            msg: >
              "Attempted to start services with a fallback option."
```


## Ansible Blocks with Asynchronous Tasks


```bash
export SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
export SMTP_PORT=587
export SMTP_USERNAME="your-email@example.com"
export SMTP_PASSWORD=your-email-password
export SMTP_TO="Admin <admin@example.com>"
```


```yaml
cat <<'EOF' > /root/ansible/playbook.yml
---
- name: Backup /var with Timeout and Notification
  hosts: all
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Backup /var Directory with Timeout
      block:
        # Asynchronous task to create a backup
        - name: Create Backup of /var
          command: tar czf /tmp/var_backup.tar.gz /var
          # Maximum time for the backup task is 10 seconds
          async: 10   
          # Run this task asynchronously 
          poll: 0     
          register: backup_result

        # Check the result of the backup task
        - name: Check Backup Status
          async_status:
            jid: "{{ backup_result.ansible_job_id }}"
          register: job_result
          until: job_result.finished
          retries: 1
          # Check after 10 seconds
          delay: 10   

      rescue:
        # Send email notification if backup fails or takes too long
        - name: Send Email to Administrator on Backup Failure
          mail:
            host: "${SMTP_HOST}"
            port: "${SMTP_PORT}"
            username: "${SMTP_USERNAME}"
            password: "${SMTP_PASSWORD}"
            to: "${SMTP_TO}"
            subject: Backup of /var Failed on {{ ansible_hostname }}
            body: >
              Backup of /var failed on {{ ansible_hostname }}. 
              Please check the system logs.
