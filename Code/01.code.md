```yaml
---
# This is the start of the Ansible playbook. 
# YAML files start with '---'

# This is a play. Each play can target different 
# or multiple hosts
- name: Update and Install Nginx  
  # 'hosts' specifies which machines to run the play on, 
  # referencing the inventory. 'webservers' could be 
  # a group in your inventory.
  hosts: webservers               

  # A list of tasks that this play will execute on the hosts
  tasks:
    # Each task has a name, which is a human-readable 
    # description of what the task does
    - name: Update apt cache      
      # This task uses the 'apt' module, which is used
      # for package management on Debian/Ubuntu systems
      apt:       
        # Perform an update of the apt package cache                 
        update_cache: yes

    # Another task in the play
    - name: Install Nginx
      # This task also uses the 'apt' module
      apt:                        
        name: nginx
        state: latest
