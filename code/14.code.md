## Host Patterns


## Debugging


### Syntax Check a Playbook


```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --syntax-check
```


### Check if Hosts Are Reachable


```bash
ansible all -m ping
```


### Check if Hosts Are Reachable with SSH


```bash
ansible all -m ping -c ssh
```


### Check if Hosts Are Reachable with WinRM


```bash
ansible all -m ping -c winrm
```


### Check if Hosts Are Reachable Locally


```bash
ansible all -m ping -c local
```


### Verbose Mode


```bash
ansible all -m ping -v
ansible all -m ping -vv
ansible all -m ping -vvv
ansible all -m ping -vvvv
ansible all -m ping -vvvvv
```


### Debug Mode


```bash
ANSIBLE_DEBUG=1 ansible all -m ping
```


### Capture Output


```yaml
---
- name: Capture Output
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Capture Output
      command: echo "Hello World!"
      register: output
    - debug:
        var: output
```


### Capture Output and Show Only Specific Fields


```yaml
---
- name: Capture Output and Show Only Specific Fields
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Capture Output and Show Only Specific Fields
      command: echo "Hello World!"
      register: output
    - debug:
        var: output.stdout
```


### Capture Output and Show Only Specific Fields with Jinja2


```yaml
---
- name: Capture Output and Show Only Specific Fields with Jinja2
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Capture Output and Show Only Specific Fields with Jinja2
      command: echo "Hello World!"
      register: output
    - debug:
        msg: "{{ output.stdout }}"
```


## Gathering Facts


### Gathering Facts for All Hosts


```bash
ansible all -m setup
```


### Gathering Facts for a Specific Host


```bash
